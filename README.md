# Post Weather




We all use the weather to start small talk with people you want to engage with or just pass time. With so many of us working from home it can be difficult to make friends or just talk to new people. 
With Post Weather you can post your current weather and start a conversation.

## Getting Started

#### I imaged my weather app to display current weather, adding your favorite cites to your profile to monitor or share. A signup/login to access your profile. And see a 3 day forecast of each city selected.

#### Adding a basic form to post current weather in your exact location. In the form you can upload an image, add city name, decription, and a checkbox of a beautiful day or if you should be alarmed.

#### The weather card shows the image you uploaded and a comment post.
